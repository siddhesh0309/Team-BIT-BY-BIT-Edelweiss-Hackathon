## Video Description
In this application we have implemented a dynamic dashboard like a NSE option chain web page we have name this application as we Stokes in the demo video. we have selected different underlyings and different corresponding dates to that particular. we have implemented the two drop downs in such a way that if we select financial stock only the expiry dates which are available with financial stocks are displayed in the second drop down this logic is being applied to rest three stocks as well you can see that the data is being dynamically changed after few seconds and the new data which we are getting from the CMD is being process and displayed. we have managed to calculate change in oi, chng, and IV.
